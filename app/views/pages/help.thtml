<h3>About the catalogue</h3><a id="h0"></a>
<p>The BHL serials union catalogue is designed to hold limited bibliographic information regarding the combined serials holdings of BHL partner institutions.
<p>Registered users can bid on whole and partial runs of serials titles to scan</p>
<p>The dataset is based upon MARC extracts from library systems, which has been automatically de-duplicated where possible. In addition, manual de-duplication tools are available for registered users to 'clean up' the catalogue.</P>
<p>The deduplication process was as follows. Matches were sought on ISSN, then OCLC number (only a few were supplied); then exact match on first 60 characters of a normalized title. There will still be records that are duplicates to be cleaned up.


<p>The catalogue interface has been written in PHP using the Cake MVC based application framework</p>

<h3>Logging in, navigating adding and editing records</h3><a id="h1"></a>
<p>
Each partner institution in the Biodiversity Heritage library consortium has a username and password allowing them to log into the catalogue.      
Logging in to the catalogue will allow users to access to its full functionality, including the ability to de-duplicate biliographic serials records and to bid on full or partial runs of serials to scan.
Users will automatically log out after ten minutes of inactivity.
</p>    
<p>Navigate using the links on the left of the page, and the crumbtrail navigation at the top. When viewing a list of records, click on the link in the actions column to view the full record and its associated bids and holdings.</p>
<p>The links on the left will change when you log in.</p>

<p>Values for different filters are shown below where they are not obvious...</p>
<ol type="i" style="margin-left: 35px;">
    <li>Place filter: AMNH; FIELD; NHM; KEW; SIL; HAR; NYBG; MBL; MOBOT</li>
    <li>Match method filter: 022 (matches by ISSN), OCLC (matches made by OCLC - very few!) TITLE (matches made by title), NO MATCH (unique records) </li>
</ol>

<h3>De-duplicating records</h3><a id="h3"></a>
<p><i>This facility is only available to registered users (*** under development - not yet there ***)</i></p>
<p>Registered users have the ability to de-duplicate identical or near identical records.</p>
<ol type="i" style="margin-left: 35px;">
    <li>When viewing serials records, click on the 'remove duplicates' link underneath the search options. This  switches the list display to de-duplication mode</li>
    <li>You then need to enter two bib ID's for de-duplication into the empty text boxes at the top of the screen. You can either type them in, or select them from the list by clicking radio buttons in the two columns on the left of the screen. Once two record keys are entered, click on the de-dup button to continue
    </li>
    <li>Both records will be displayed next to each other. They can both be edited here if needs be. </li>
    <li>To de-duplicate, choose one record to keep. All matches, holdings and bids related to the discarded record will be transfered to the record you wish to keep.</li>
    <li>This process is currently non-reversable</li>
</ol>
